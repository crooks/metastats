This software analysis standard remailer statistics files, such as those
generated by Echolot.  It aggregates all the data and produces metastats that
provide a view of each remailer's reliability and latency from multiple
perspectives.

It now needs some serious updating......

As my first Python project, the learning curve was steep.  Wrong turns were taken
and complexity introduced where none was needed.  The goal now is to get the code
into shape and make it modular.

The first goal: Remove the dependency on PostgreSQL and use PySQLite.
